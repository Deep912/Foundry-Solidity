## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

## My Solidity Adventure üöÄ

Welcome to my **Solidity + Foundry framework learning journey**‚Äîor as I like to call it, the "road to blockchain wizardry." üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® This repo is where I boldly experiment, break things (on purpose... mostly), and occasionally wonder why gas fees aren‚Äôt paid in actual fuel. ‚õΩ

Think of it as my blockchain diary‚Äîfilled with triumphs, bugs, and enough `require` statements to make my head spin. Follow along as I try to forge (pun intended) my way into the world of smart contracts!

Expect to see:
- **Code that works** (eventually, after enough tears).
- **Gas wars with myself** (because apparently, I like pain).
- **Deployments that might break the blockchain (but hey, that‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs problem, right?).**

### Why am I doing this? üßê

Great question. Is it because I love the thrill of debugging code at 2 AM? Or maybe I just enjoy yelling "it works on my machine!" before realizing I forgot to set the gas limit. Either way, this journey is part coding, part chaos, and 100% entertainment (for you, not always for me).

If you're learning Solidity too, grab some popcorn üçø, and watch me try not to `revert` my progress. Pro tip: bring a debugger and a sense of humor‚Äîyou‚Äôll need both!
